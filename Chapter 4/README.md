Create a multiclient server that can read commands (text) from a file and send it to the connected client.<br><br>
The server can be started using `python multiClientBotServer.py`<br>
Once the server is started, open another terminal and connect to it, for example by using `nc localhost 8000`.<br>
Once you send a message to the server, the server is going to send back the text from the commands.txt file.
