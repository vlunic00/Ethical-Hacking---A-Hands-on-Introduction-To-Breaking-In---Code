# Exercise 2<br><br>
Create a script that executes a SYN Scan attack on a given IP address and a designated port (should probably be updated to scan all ports)<br>
The scapy Python library is used and therefore should be [installed](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) (for example `pip install scapy`).<br>
To execute the script call `python synScanner.py <IP address> <port>`
